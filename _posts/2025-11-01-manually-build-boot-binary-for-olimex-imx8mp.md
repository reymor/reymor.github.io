Sometimes it is helpful to build boot binary outside of Yocto environment. In this, I will explore to boot

For the i.MX8MP SoC a boot image is generated by imx-mkimage tool and requires:

- uboot-imx
- TF-A
- ddr training firmware

1. Donwload and build the uboot-imx

2. Download and build the TF-A (ARM Trusted firmware)

3. Download the LPDDR4 training binaries

4. Download imx-mkimage and build the image

5. Program on the uSD

```
dd if=flash.bin of=/dev/<path 2 your uSD> bs=1K seek=32 conv=fsync
```

`seek` offset is taken from UG10163 [i.MX Linux User's Guide](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UG10163.pdf)
