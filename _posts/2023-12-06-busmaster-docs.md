[BUSMASTER](https://github.com/rbei-etas/busmaster) is a user friendly and cost effective testing and development tool for CAN bus systems (also LIN). It helps monitoring, analyzing and simulation of CAN message on the bus. It is sad that this projects was abandoned and it seems really difficult that it will got maintained again. The last official release was BUSMASTER v3.2.2. The idea of this post is to share the documenation that I compile from source code in the last release.

It seems that these documents are not updated with the last changes. However, I have taken them from main branch. So, these are the last documents that we got.
